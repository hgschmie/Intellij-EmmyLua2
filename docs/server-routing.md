# Routing files to externally managed EmmyLua servers

Plugins can implement `com.cppcxy.ide.lsp.EmmyLuaServerProvider` and register:

```xml
<extensions defaultExtensionNs="com.cppcxy.Intellij-EmmyLua">
    <serverProvider implementation="your.plugin.ModuleServerProvider"/>
</extensions>
```

`getServerId(Project, VirtualFile)` returns the LSP4IJ server ID for a file,
or null to abstain. The first nonblank result wins (IntelliJ extension ordering
applies); otherwise routing selects `EmmyLua`. Returning `EmmyLua` explicitly
also selects the default. Providers must perform fast, thread-safe lookups.

A non-default selection excludes the file from EmmyLua's default document
mapping. The provider must register and manage the replacement LSP4IJ server,
its document mappings, workspace/configuration, file synchronization and cleanup.
Its server interface must extend `EmmyLuaCustomApi` for gutter requests.
Return the assigned ID while a server is starting or unavailable; do not fall
back to the project-wide server on temporary failure.

Gutter requests use the selected ID, cached results are scoped by project and
server, and detail requests retain the ID that produced the gutter data. Stale
markers are ignored if routing has changed. Integrations changing ownership
must disconnect existing LSP document associations, refresh their mappings and
restart editor analysis; this extension point does not migrate live connections.
Invalidate gutter caches with `LuaGutterCacheManager.clearCache(file.url)` when
replacing a server under the same ID. Register stable server IDs unique to the
owning project and environment, and remove them on disposal.

Without a provider, the existing default-server behavior is preserved. This
hook does not itself start multiple servers or impose a module isolation model.

## Workspace ownership

File routing keeps editor requests on the right server. To also keep the default
analyzer from indexing integration-owned source directories, implement
`EmmyLuaServerProvider.getOwnedRoots(Project)`. Return immutable absolute paths
from the same snapshot used for file routing, including roots reserved while a
server starts. Do not discover roots or start processes inside this callback.

The default server removes owned workspace folders and appends `workspace.ignoreDir`
through `workspace/configuration`. The exclusions also cover an owned module
nested below a broader project root. Existing configuration files are not edited.
Explicit library/package roots remain available as imports under EmmyLua's normal
ignore-directory semantics; explicitly configured `workspaceRoots` also remain
user-controlled. Ownership controls the automatically discovered workspace scan,
not whether another environment may deliberately include a dependency.

After updating the snapshot, call `EmmyLuaServerRouting.ownershipChanged(project)`
on the EDT, then refresh affected editors. This stops the default server without
disabling it or starting a new one. The next unclaimed Lua file starts it with the
new roots, including when ownership is released. Existing per-file providers are
compatible: the default implementation advertises no owned roots.
